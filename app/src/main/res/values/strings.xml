    <string name="txtRecipe">+ Salmon Meunière + \n\n Ingredients \n\n Fresh Salmon Steak  • 3 lbs \n Butter \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t • 1/2 stick (4 tbsp) \n Salt and Pepper \t\t\t\t\t • as needed \n AP Flour \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t • as needed \n\n Equip \n\n • Sharp knife and cutting board \n • Needle nose pliers or tweezers \n • Shallow pan or plate (for dredging) \n • Large frying pan \n • Tongs \n\n
        Walkthrough \n\n STEP 1 \n\t The first step is to remove the ribs from the inside of the steak. Use a thin, sharp knife to carefully slice a line between the bones (you’ll be able to feel them) and the rest of the fish. Cut on both sides of the salmon so you have something that resembles the bottom left picture below. Once the ribs are separated, hold the knife vertically and draw the blade around the spine of the fish to completely remove it. \n\n
        STEP 2 \n\t If you run your fingers over the top of the salmon steak you’ll most likely feel several hard bumps along the surface. These are called pin bones. Use a pair of needle nose pliers or tweezers to firmly grasp the tip of each pin and pull them out at an angle. Be careful not to snap the bone by pulling too fast. Ensure that all the pin bones have been removed and we can finally get cooking! \n\n
        STEP 3 \n\t Prepare the salmon to be dredged by first liberally seasoning the fish with salt and pepper. Fill a shallow cake pan or something similar with about 3/4 cup of flour and place the salmon cut side down.  Cover the entire steak in flour (including the insides and the skin) by turning it over gently and sprinkling more flour on top when necessary. \n\n
        STEP 4 \n\t In a large frying pan over medium heat melt the 4 tbsp of butter until it begins to bubble. Carefully place the salmon steak skin side down to begin with. This will ensure the skin will be nice and crispy and will help keep the salmon from falling apart. After about 3 minutes, use tongs to flip the fish on to the other skin side to crisp that up as well. After another 3 minutes you can finally place the fish cut side down and fry it for 4 minutes on each side. \n\n
        + Beurre Blanc + \n\n Ingredients \n\n Butter \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t • 1/2 stick (4 tbsp) \n Heavy Cream \t\t • 1/2 cup \n AP Flour \t\t\t\t\t\t • 1 tbsp \n White Wine \t\t\t • 2 tbsp \n Lemon Juice \t\t\t • 1 lemon \n Chives \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t • 1 tbsp (chopped fine) \n Salt  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t • 1/4 tsp \n\n Equip \n\n • Frying pan \n • Whisk \n • Sharp knife and cutting board \n\n
        Walkthrough \n\n STEP 1 \n\t This sauce comes together in a snap and it’s definitely one that comes up a lot in classic cuisine. Feel free to wipe out the pan you cooked the salmon in and use it again for this recipe (no sense making more dishes to wash later!) Start with your pan over low heat and melt the butter. Once it’s liquefied, add the flour and whisk vigorously to create a roux. Let the rough cook while stirring for about 20 seconds and then add in the heavy cream. \n\n
        STEP 2 \n\t Continue to whisk the sauce. It may look broken at this point but don’t worry; pour in the white wine and lemon juice and the sauce should come back together. Once the sauce is homogeneous, remove it from the heat and add the chives and the salt. Stir to combine and use immediately. \n\n
        FINALLY \n
        Pour the sauce over the fried salmon or use it as a side to dip it in. If the sauce begins to get weird on you, just return it to low heat and whisk in a little more liquid and it should smooth back out. This dish really goes to show you that while it make take a little more effort than throwing everything in a cooking pot (Link) it’s fairly straightforward to make a fancy dinner for yourself and others if you just give it a shot. Believe me, this one’s sure to impress.</string>
